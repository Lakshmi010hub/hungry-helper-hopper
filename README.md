### Project Description
Reduce food waste and help the communities in need. The lack of an efficient platform to connect food surplus providers with organizations or individuals in need results in both wasted resources and missed opportunities to address a critical social issue.

 
### The Problem statement
"Reducing Food Wastage Through Efficient Redistribution".
In many urban areas, large quantities of food from restaurants, catering events, and other functions go to waste daily despite the presence of individuals and communities facing hunger and food insecurity. 

### The Solution
Our goal is to create a user-friendly, sustainable website, enabling restaurants and catering services to donate excess food in real-time while ensuring safe handling and distribution to those in need, ultimately reducing food wastage and contributing to hunger relief.
